# Task 1.1 documentation

On this task we used the Kali Linux Metasploit framework to compromise a service on the Metasploitable2 victim machine.

---
## Step 1: Identify the attacker (Kali Linux) and the victim (Metasploitable 2) IP addresses
Before attacking, we need to know the IP addresses to ensure that the attack will be directed toward the desired target.
- **IP addresses screenshots**:

## step 2: ensuer that kali is connected to the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine
- pinging the other virtual machine:

## step 3: finding the volners that could be exploited:
- we did it through a command that output the script of the volnerabilities on ports number 21, 22, and 80.
